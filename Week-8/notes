Either in the interactive shell or in a Python file if you want to save it, 
loop through the content of the folder text_files and print out the name 
of each file in the folder.

>>> os.listdir('text-files')
['a-drinking-song-yeats.txt', 'mercutio.txt', 'the-start-teasdale.txt', 'chrismas-carol.txt']

Write a Python script that opens the file mercutio.txt 
in the folder text-files and prints the first 10 lines.

>>> f = open('text-files/mercutio.txt', 'r')
>>> for x in range (10):
...     print(f.readline())
... 

to close the file:

f.close()

Open the christmas-carol.txt file and rewrite the ending. 
Remove the last set of paragraphs and replace the text with 
a new ending where Scrooge did not learn any lessons. 
Write out your new ending to the text file and then open it 
in a text editor to verify that your changes worked

>>> f = open("christmas-carol.txt", "w")
>>> f.write("hello")
>>> f = open("christmas-carol.txt", "r")
>>> print(f.read())
hello

Write a Python script that creates a new file named the 
current time and date (see the time module) which contains a 
description what you will do over the holidays and saves the 
file in the text-files folder (located in the same folder as this README).

>>> f = open(time.asctime() + ".txt", "x")
